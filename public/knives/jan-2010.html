      <p>
        I have entered another KITH (knife in a hat) which is to be drawn in
        January. The theme was to forge a knife from a file. I decided that
        firstly, I wanted it to be obvious that the knife came from a file. And
        secondly, I wanted to forge another integral knife.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last time I was at the council tip, I picked up a big box of old files
        and punches for five pounds and it contained a large (blunt!) round
        file. I decided it would make good stock for this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used a fullering tool to forge the start of the handle, and then using
        a ball pien hammer forged the blade shape. I was careful to try and
        leave the file teeth visible on the handle and the back of blade. I
        finished the end of the handle by carefully heating it and forging it to
        a rounded profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        The blade is fully heat treated and tempered, and the handle is
        surprisingly comfortable. Here are some pictures:
