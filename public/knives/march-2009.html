        <h1>a 4 1/4 inch utility knife with pattern welded blade</h1>

      <p>
        This knife was finished in March 2009. I wanted to experiment with a
        mutiple bar damascus pattern, and decided to try the Gordian Knot
        pattern as described in "The Complete Bladesmith".
      </p>
      <p>
        I started with the usual 9 layers of CS70 and 15n20 tool steels, forge
        welded these together, folded the billet to make 18 layers and drew it
        out into a square bar just over 5/8 of an inch wide. I then twisted half
        the bar clockwise, and the other half anticlockwise and forged it square
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I cut the bar into four equal lengths, and stacked them together to
        form a short wide bar with (looking from the end of the bar) the
        clockwise bars placed top left and bottom right, and the anti bars top
        right and bottom left. In this way the opposite bars were adjacent to
        each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        This composite bar was then forge welded into a solid round bar and
        twisted again before final forging into a blade. As you can see in the
        pictures, the pattern formed is quite complex, and I'm pleased with the
        way it turned out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The guard and pin are brass with a leather spacer and Zebrano wood
        handle.
