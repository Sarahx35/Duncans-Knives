        <h1>a pattern welded friction folding knife</h1>

        It has a 2 1/8 inch blade with micarta handle. Closed length is 4 7/8
        inches
      </h2>
      <p>
        I made this knife for a "scrap keychain knife kith". The challenge was
        to make a small knife that could be carried on a key ring, and using a
        scrap piece of steel. I used a 5 inch piece of 36 layer steel left over
        when I made my belt buckle:

      <p>
        I started by twisting the bar to make the pattern tighter. Then I cut it
        in half and forged two blade blanks. Here is a picture of the half bar
        and one blank forged:

      <p>And here are the two blanks:</p>
      <img src="/src/images/knives/twenty_six_b.jpg" />
      <p>
        The next photo shows the two blades (before hardening) placed on the
        micarta block which I used to make the handle.

        Time was getting on and I couldn't finish both knives by the 30th June
        deadline, so here is a picture showing one etched blade and shaped
        handle with the other knife at an earlier stage:
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are pictures of the finished knife. There is a fault in the steel
        at the back near the handle. This doesn't affect the strength, but isn't
        very pretty. However, I am pleased with the way the pattern turned out,
        and it works well considering it is my first friction folder. I have
        left the rivets proud of the handle, so they can be adjusted if the
        blade becomes too loose.
