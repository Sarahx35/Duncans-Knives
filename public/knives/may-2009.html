        <h1>a blacksmith's knife with a 4 inch blade</h1>

        <h2>May 2009</h2>

      <p>
        This knife was finished in May 2009 from an old leaf spring from a
        Daihatsu Fourtrack. Jacks Hammerin is on the theme of recycling this
        year, and I made this knife as a contribution to the raffle. It is a
        blacksmith's style knife with forged finish, because this is the
        quickest way to make a knife. I am hoping some people may want to try
        making one at the hammerin, and we can use this knife as a patern.
      </p>
      <p>
        I forged a taper into the blade and forged as close to the finished
        shape as possible. The only part that has been ground is the point and
        edge area. The blade is fully hardened and has a convex polished edge
        that is shaving sharp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently I have made my own stamp from an old punch, so I am marking
        items I have forged with this now, as you can see in the top photo.
