      <p>
        I have been keen to make an axe for a long time. My first attempt looked
        OK, but due to a some confusion at a hammerin, it turned out to have a
        mild steel edge, so I threw it away!
      </p>
      <p>
        I bought a few hickory 14 inch hatchet handles, and ground an old punch
        to shape to make a drift to shape the eye of the axe head. Here is a
        picture of the handle and the finished drift:
      </p>
      <img src="/src/images/knives/twenty_three_a.jpg" />
      <p>
        I decided to make the body and eye of the axe from 1/4 inch mild steel
        sheet, and the edge steel from 3/16 inch EN42 tool steel. The tool steel
        insert is unusual, because it is much larger than usual with this style
        of axe. The reason I did this was that my gas forge doesn't get hot
        enough to weld mild steel to itself. The tool steel melts at a lower
        temperature and will stick to the mild. Consequently the tool steel
        insert has to be large enough to prevent any direct contact of the
        sides. Here is a picture of the parts and drift ready to use:
      </p>

      <p>
        The first step is to bend the hot mild sheet using the anvil, and to
        insert the tool steel into the gap. Before folding I cleaned the faces
        to be welded and applied borax flux at red heat. This picture shows the
        insert roughly in place:
      </p>
      <img src="/src/images/knives/twenty_three_c.jpg" />
      <p>
        The head was heated and the surfaces forged closer together as can be
        seen below. You can't see the insert, because it has dropped out of
        position. In fact keeping it in the correct place while forge welding is
        the most tricky part.
      </p>
      <img src="/src/images/knives/twenty_three_d.jpg" />
      <p>
        I soaked the head in the forge for quite a long time, until it was all
        at welding temperature, and hammered it by hand to weld it. In the
        picture below, you can see that the insert was slightly too small. After
        this photo, I ground off the excess mild steel.
      </p>

      <p>
        I then forged the head to shape, and refined the eye by hammering the
        drift into it. The eye is larger at the top to ensure that the handle
        can't come off in use. Please note that I left the edge thick, because I
        didn't want the tool steel insert compressed too much and it is
        important that mild steel doesn't form the finished edge. Here is the
        forged head prior to grinding:

      <p>
        After grinding the edge area to expose the tool steel edge, I hardened
        the blade in oil. Here is a picture of the hardened blade, if you look
        carefully the exposed EN42 is visible for about 1/8 inch from the edge:

      <p>
        The head was then cleaned with a wire brush, tempered at 450F in our
        oven, and sharpened. I fitted the handel with a custom made hardwood
        wedge and an iron hammer wedge. Here is a photo of the finished hatchet
        after trying it out:
