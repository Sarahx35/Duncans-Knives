      <p>
        These knives were finished in May 2008. For a long time I have wanted to
        make a pattern welded penknife of my own design that I could use every
        day. This time I decided to make a blade well under the legal 3 inches,
        because it makes the knife much less noticable when used in public.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also decided to copy the Swiss Army knife by not having a metal
        bolster which I feel makes the blade seem longer than it really is. I
        also used a traditional British style penknife blade, because the blunt
        tip looks less agressive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I forged a 36 layer billet of CS70 and 15n20 tool steels, and had enough
        to make two blades, so I decided to make two whole penknives in case one
        didn't work out. In fact both have turned out well, so I will give one
        away as a present.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some consideration I used black linen micarta instead of wood for
        the handle scales, because it is strong enough to rivet straight into.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a picture of the parts for one of the knives ready to be riveted
        together:

        This is one of the finished knives when closed. I took care to ensure
        the pivot end of the blade is covered by the sides, so there aren't any
        sharp projections (a lesson learned from my first folder!).

      <p>Here are two photos showing each side of the finished opened knife:</p>

      <p>
        Here are two photos of the back of the knife. I was pleased that for the
        first time I managed to get the spring sitting in the same position open
        and closed. This is something I have found surprisingly difficult to
        achieve:

      <p>
        Finally here is a photo of the two completed knives. The blade shapes
        are slightly different, but otherwise I am pleased with the way they
        turned out:
