                The upright has been installed now. The top shock absorber mounting bolt is very difficult
                to install. The manual says gently push the alloy inwards to remove/replace the bolt.
                I found that I had to bend the alloy skin with a wooden block to make the job even possible.

                I'd heard fitting the differential was tricky, and they were right. Here it is in place after
about 4 hours work. The trick is to locate the top temporarily with a bar, and to locate the lower
bolts, taking care to centralise the diff using lots of washers. It can be up to 2mm to one side
I'm pleased to say mine is in the middle. The long top bolt that had to be bevelled at the end and
drifted into place with some timber and a 21/2 pound club hammer. I just hope I don't have to disturb
it for a long time.

                Here the car has its wheels on for the first time. With our sloping driveway and small
                garage, I had to find a way to safely roll the car out of the garage to make room for the crane
                that I will use to install the engine. I bought some timber and screwed the pieces together to make
                ramps, and rested the ends on my old wheel ramps. The ramps are horizontal and allow me to easily
                roll the car in and out by hand. Note the clamped wheel chock to make sure I don't overshoot.

                wide to go between the front wheels! I had to use spacers on the hubs. There was no way I could have installed
                the engine on my own. I'd heard the clearances were tight, but didn't realise quite how tight! Here Alison is

                <p class="instructions-text">I'm looking pleased here, because I have just finished fitting the front wings and the indicator repeaters.
                    The wings are straight forward to fit, but any mistake with measuring or with the drill would show up very badly!
                    The repeater wiring is a pain, because it has to travel down a thin tube and a gromit is needed where the cables enter
                    and leave the tube. The exit gromit is very difficult to fit, and wasn't supplied with the kit.</p>

                    Fitting the rear wings is quite tricky even though the bolts holes are pre-drilled. The nearside wing lined
                    up alright, but most of the holes on the offside needed to be adjusted. I found bonding the beading strip to the wing
                    edge and punching the holes for the bolts before trying to put the wings on worked well.

                    done before the wing goes on.

                    working temperature. The clutch is dragging a bit, and we had to add extra coolant as the air in the system
                    bled, but otherwise all went well. The fan worked and there was good oil pressure, and so far no sign of leaks.</p>

                    Unfortunately the original radiator soon started leaking, so I have replaced it with a much better one from
                    Radtec as you can see above.
