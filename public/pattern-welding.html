        <h2>The Procedures Involved In Pattern Welding</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Please note: the photos below do not all show the same billet.</p>
      <p>
        Pattern welding has been used for a very long time. The Vikings
        certainly mastered the process and made some sword blades that are very
        difficult to replicate even with all the modern tools available now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, the smiths had poor quality steel, and iron to work with.
        The iron was soft but tough, and the steel was harder, but more brittle.
        By combining the two materials a superior weapon could be produced. As a
        side effect beautiful patterns were visible in the surface of the steel.
      </p>
      <p>
        With modern steels, there is no need to use pattern welding, but the
        process can still be used to make attractive, unique blades and is also
        great fun to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first stage is to get two types of steel, ideally these should both
        be hardenable tool steels but they need to be different enough to see
        the pattern. In this case I have shown CS70 (a plain 0.7% carbon steel -
        the five pieces below) and 15n20 (a similar carbon steel with a high
        nickel content - the four pieces below).

            The steel strips need to be held tightly together, so they can be
            arc welded into stack called a billet. it is also a good idea to
            weld on a handle as you need to be able to hold it securely.

          <p class="instructions-text">
            The steel is heated to red heat, and then borax is sprinkled on as a
            flux. The most important action of the flux is to keep oxygen away
            from the steel, to keep the metal clean and free of oxides (known as
            scale).
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="wrap-text">
        The billet is heated to bright orange/yellow in colour and the flux can
        be seem to be bubbling and moving rapidly over the surface. At this
        point the surfaces are slightly molten, and the billet is quickly taken
        to the anvil and hit with a hammer. If everything is right the layers
        will weld together. With a hand hammer it is only possible to weld a
        couple of inches at a time.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap-text">
        Once welded the billet will look like this.

          <p class="instructions-text">Once welded the billet will look like this.</p>
          <p class="instructions-text">Initially I start with 9 layers, and to increase the layer count to
            vary the pattern, I draw out the billet to double its original
            length.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="wrap-text"> I then cut 3/4 the way through the middle of the bar with a
        chisel, and fold it back upon itself. The bar is refluxed and
        reheated to welding temperature and welded together. This procedure
        can be repeated indefinitely, but each time more steel is burned off
        and more layers than 300 will give a subtle pattern. More than 1000
        can't be seen.</p>
      <p class="wrap-text">Here is a cooled bar with about seventy layers.</p>

            The next stage is to maniplulate the layers to produce the required pattern. There are hundreds of
ways to do this by cutting, grinding, drilling, and combining bars. Here I have twisted the billet.

            The bar would then be squared up, and then forged to the desired shape, prior to grinding, and
heat treating. Here is a knife forging straight from the forge.
