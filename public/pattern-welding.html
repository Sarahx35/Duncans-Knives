      <h2>The Procedures Involved In Pattern Welding</h2>
      <p>Please note: the photos below do not all show the same billet.</p>
      <p>
        Pattern welding has been used for a very long time. The Vikings
        certainly mastered the process and made some sword blades that are very
        difficult to replicate even with all the modern tools available now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, the smiths had poor quality steel, and iron to work with.
        The iron was soft but tough, and the steel was harder, but more brittle.
        By combining the two materials a superior weapon could be produced. As a
        side effect beautiful patterns were visible in the surface of the steel.
      </p>
      <p>
        With modern steels, there is no need to use pattern welding, but the
        process can still be used to make attractive, unique blades and is also
        great fun to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first stage is to get two types of steel, ideally these should both
        be hardenable tool steels but they need to be different enough to see
        the pattern. In this case I have shown CS70 (a plain 0.7% carbon steel -
        the five pieces below) and 15n20 (a similar carbon steel with a high
        nickel content - the four pieces below).
