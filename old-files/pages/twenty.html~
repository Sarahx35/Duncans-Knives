  <b>Knife Twenty - a 4 1/4 inch utility knife with pattern welded blade.
  </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 </font>
Thise knife was finished in March 2009. I wanted to experiment with a mutiple bar damascus pattern,<br>
and decided to try the Gordian Knot pattern as described in "The Complete Bladesmith".<br>
<br>
I started with the usual 9 layers of CS70 and 15n20 tool steels, forge welded these together,<br>
folded the billet to make 18 layers and drew it out into a square bar just over 5/8 of an inch wide.<br>
I then twisted half the bar clockwise, and the other half anticlockwise and forged it square again.<br>
<br>
Then I cut the bar into four equal lengths, and stacked them together to form a short wide bar with<br>
(looking from the end of the big bar) the clockwise bars placed top left and bottom right, and the<br>
anti bars top right and bottom left. In this way the opposite bars were adjacent to each other.<br>
<br>
This composite bar was then forge welded into a solid round bar and twisted again before final forging<br>
into a blade. As you can see in the pictures, the pattern formed is quite complex, and I'm pleased with<br>
the way it turned out.<br> 
<br>
The guard and pin are brass with a leather spacer and Zebrano wood handle.<br>
<br>
Here are some pictures of the finished knife:<br>
