  <b>Twenty Six - a pattern welded friction folding knife.<br>
It has a 2 1/8 inch blade with micarta handle. Closed length is 4 7/8 inches<br>
  </b>
  </font>
<br>
<br>
I made this knife for a "scrap keychain knife kith". The challenge was to make a small<br>
knife that could be carried on a key ring, and using a scrap piece of steel. I used a<br>
5 inch piece of 36 layer steel left over when I made my belt buckle:<br>

<br>
I started by twisting the bar to make the pattern tighter. Then I cut it in half and forged<br>
two blade blanks. Here is a picture of the half bar and one blank forged:<br>

<br>
And here are the two blanks:<br>

<br>
<br>
The next photo shows the two blades (before hardening) placed on the micarta block which I used<br>
to make the handle.<br>

Time was getting on and I couldn't finish both knives by the 30th June deadline, so here is a picture<br>
showing one etched blade and shaped handle with the other knife at an earlier stage:<br>

<br>
Here are pictures of the finished knife. There is a fault in the steel at the back near the handle.<br>
This doesn't affect the strength, but isn't very pretty. However, I am pleased with the way the pattern<br>
turned out, and it works well considering it is my first friction folder. I have left the rivets proud of<br>
the handle, so they can be adjusted if the blade becomes too loose.<br>
