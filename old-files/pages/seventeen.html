  <b>Knife Seventeen-A two inch blade Scandinavian style knife
  </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 </font>
This knife was finished in December 2007. I made it to go into another British Blades<br>
"Knives in the hat" which is due to finish early in January. There are nine people involved<br>
and we are making any style of knife, but the blade must be 2 inches long or less.<br>
<br>
Some Scandinavian knives have a short blade relative to the handle, so I decided to make <br>
one of those, as it should be more useable.<br>
<br>
The blade is a piece of 72 layer CS70 and 15n20 twisted and etched in ferric chloride.<br>
The handle is Mexican Rosewood, and the guard is made from Tagua nut. I was given a<br> 
Tagua nut by P S Bonds from British Blades several years ago, and had wondered how to use it.<br>
It is also known as vegetable ivory, and is extremely hard with no obvious grain.<br>
It is a nice material, but unfortunately the nuts have a large void in the middle,<br>
and there is very little useable material from each nut.<br>
