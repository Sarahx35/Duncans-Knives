  <b>Knife Six-A Kukri
  </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 </font>
I have always loved kukris, partly it's the appearance, and partly the amazing ability<br> 
to chop through branches with so little effort. I have looked for a good original kukri,<br>
but never found one of good quality. Consequently, I decided to make my own.<br>
<br>
I used a piece of truck spring, and forged it to profile with the help of Merv. A<br> 
sledge hammer was required! We found out how they curve the blade though, as we narrowed<br>
the blade at the curve, the end just bent up automatically. In fact we had to keep <br>
straightening the blade.<br>
<br>
The guard is solid brass, the wood American Black Walnut, and I used both a pin and a nut<br>
on the end of the tang. I certainly don't want the blade coming loose, as it is 13 inches long.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the rough forging, next to an original kukri:<br>

This is after some grinding, before I decided to change the tang design:<br>
