  <b>Twenty Three - a composite hatchet with a 4 inch edge.
  </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 </font>
I have been keen to make an axe for a long time. My first attempt looked OK, but due to a some<br>
confusion at a hammerin, it turned out to have a mild steel edge, so I threw it away!<br>
<br>
I bought a few hickory 14 inch hatchet handles, and ground an old punch to shape to make<br>
a drift to shape the eye of the axe head. Here is a picture of the handle and the finished drift:<br>
<br>

 <br>
<br>
I decided to make the body and eye of the axe from 1/4 inch mild steel sheet, and the edge steel<br>
from 3/16 inch EN42 tool steel. The tool steel insert is unusual, because it is much larger than usual<br>
with this style of axe. The reason I did this was that my gas forge doesn't get hot enough to<br>
weld mild steel to itself. The tool steel melts at a lower temperature and will stick to the mild.<br>
Consequently the tool steel insert has to be large enough to prevent any direct contact of the sides.<br>
Here is a picture of the parts and drift ready to use:<br>

<br>
<br>
The first step is to bend the hot mild sheet using the anvil, and to insert the tool steel into the gap.<br>
Before folding I cleaned the faces to be welded and applied borax flux at red heat. This picture shows<br>
the insert roughly in place:<br>

 <br>
<br>
The head was heated and the surfaces forged closer together as can be seen below. You can't<br>
see the insert, because it has dropped out of position. In fact keeping it in the correct place<br>
while forge welding is the most tricky part.<br>

 <br>
<br>
I soaked the head in the forge for quite a long time, until it was all at welding temperature, and<br>
hammered it by hand to weld it. In the picture below, you can see that the insert was slightly too small.<br>
After this photo, I ground off the excess mild steel.<br>

<br>
I then forged the head to shape, and refined the eye by hammering the drift into it. The eye is<br>
larger at the top to ensure that the handle can't come off in use. Please note that I left the edge<br>
thick, because I didn't want the tool steel insert compressed too much and it is important that<br>
mild steel doesn't form the finished edge. Here is the forged head prior to grinding:<br>

 <br>
<br>
After grinding the edge area to expose the tool steel edge, I hardened the blade in oil. Here is<br>
a picture of the hardened blade, if you look carefully the exposed EN42 is visible for about 1/8 inch<br>
from the edge:<br>

<br>
The head was then cleaned with a wire brush, tempered at 450F in our oven, and sharpened.<br>
I fitted the handel with a custom made hardwood wedge and an iron hammer wedge. Here is a photo of<br>
the finished hatchet after trying it out:<br>
