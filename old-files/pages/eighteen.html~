  <b>Knives Eighteen and Nineteen-Two 2 inch bladed penknives.
  </b>
 <br>

These knives were finished in May 2008. For a long time I have wanted to make a pattern welded<br>
penknife of my own design that I could use every day. This time I decided to make a blade well<br>
under the legal 3 inches, because it makes the knife much less noticable when used in public.<br>
<br>
I also decided to copy the Swiss Army knife by not having a metal bolster which I feel makes the<br>
blade seem longer than it really is. I also used a traditional British style penknife blade,<br>
because the blunt tip looks less agressive.<br>
<br>
I forged a 36 layer billet of CS70 and 15n20 tool steels, and had enough to make two blades, so<br>
I decided to make two whole penknives in case one didn't work out. In fact both have turned out<br>
well, so I will give one away as a present.<br>
<br>
After some consideration I used black linen micarta instead of wood for the handle scales, because<br>
it is strong enough to rivet straight into.<br>
<br>
Here is a picture of the parts for one of the knives ready to be riveted together:<br>

This is one of the finished knives when closed. I took care to ensure the pivot end of the blade<br>
is covered by the sides, so there aren't any sharp projections (a lesson learned from my first folder!).<br>

Here are two photos showing each side of the finished opened knife:

Here are two photos of the back of the knife. I was pleased that for the first time I managed to get<br>
the spring sitting in the same position open and closed. This is something I have found surprisingly<br>
difficult to achieve:<br>

Finally here is a photo of the two completed knives. The blade shapes are slightly different, but<br> otherwise I am pleased with the way they turned out:<br>
