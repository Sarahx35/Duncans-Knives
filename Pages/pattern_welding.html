The Procedures Involved In Pattern Welding
  </b>
 </font>
<br>
<br>
Please note: the photos below do not all show the same billet.
<br>
<br>
Pattern welding has been used for a very long time. The Vikings certainly mastered the process<br>
and made some sword blades that are very difficult to replicate even with all the modern tools<br>
available now.<br>
<br>
Originally, the smiths had poor quality steel, and iron to work with. The iron was soft but tough,<br> and the steel was harder, but more brittle. By combining the two materials a superior weapon could<br>
be produced. As a side effect beautiful patterns were visible in the surface of the steel.<br>
<br>
With modern steels, there is no need to use pattern welding, but the process can still be used<br>
to make attractive, unique blades and is also great fun to do.<br>
<br>
The first stage is to get two types of steel, ideally these should both be hardenable tool steels<br>
but they need to be different enough to see the pattern. In this case I have shown CS70 (a plain<br> 0.7% carbon steel - the five pieces below) and 15n20 (a similar carbon steel with a high nickel<br> content - the four pieces below).<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The steel strips need to be held tightly together, so they can be arc welded into stack called a<br> billet. it is also a good idea to weld on a handle as you need to be able to hold it securely.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The steel is heated to red heat, and then borax is sprinkled on as a flux. The most important<br>
action of the flux is to keep oxygen away from the steel, to keep the metal clean and free of<br>
oxides (known as scale).<br>
<br>
The billet is heated to bright orange/yellow in colour and the flux can be seem to be bubbling<br>
and moving rapidly over the surface. At this point the surfaces are slightly molten, and the<br>
billet is quickly taken to the anvil and hit with a hammer. If everything is right the layers<br>
will weld together. With a hand hammer it is only possible to weld a couple of inches at a time.<br>
<br>
Once welded the billet will look like this image below:<br>

<br>
<br>
Initially I start with 9 layers, and to increase the layer count to vary the pattern, I draw out<br>
the billet to double its original length. I then cut 3/4 the way through the middle of the bar<br>
with a chisel, and fold it back upon itself. The bar is refluxed and reheated to welding temperature<br>
and welded together. This procedure can be repeated indefinitely, but each time more steel is burned<br>
off and more layers than 300 will give a subtle pattern. More than 1000 can't be seen.<br>
<br>
Below is a cooled bar with about seventy layers:<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The next stage is to maniplulate the layers to produce the required pattern. There are hundreds of<br> ways to do this by cutting, grinding, drilling, and combining bars. Here I have twisted the billet:<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The bar would then be squared up, and then forged to the desired shape, prior to grinding, and<br>
heat treating. Below is a knife forging straight from the forge:<br>
