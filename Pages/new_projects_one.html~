My latest project is to build a Caterham Roadsport kitcar.<br>
Below are photos of the build in order of date with the latest first.<br>
<br>
Explanations are below the pictures:
   </b>
  </font>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/020_NS_driveshaft.jpg"><br>
<br>
21/12/10-This photo shows the near side driveshaft fitted. The OS shaft was fine, but the NS would not go<br>
into the diff fully. I'm not sure why, but several hours of using various techniques failed. I phoned Caterham<br>
yesterday morning, and this morning a replacement shaft arrived by courier! The replacement slotted in<br> 
without any effort.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/019_NS_shock_and_trailing_arm.jpg"><br>
<br>
19/12/10-This photo shows the near side rear shock absorber and trailing arm mounted. The rear suspension<br>
is located laterally by an A frame below the De Dion tube that is fitted next. I have sprayed the inside of<br>
the tube with Dinitrol to protect it against rust. I have also sprayed the shock mountings as access will<br>
be difficult once the build is finished.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/018_De_Dion_brake_lines.jpg"><br>
<br>
19/12/10-Here is the flexible brake hose joined to the union on the De Dion tube. As you can see there<br>
is very little clearance between the tube and the differential. I have protected the chassis tubes with<br>
insulation used for water pipes as recommended on the internet.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/017_rear_brake_hose.jpg"><br>
<br>
19/12/10-This is the join between the fixed brake line and the flexible hose that goes to the lines mounted<br>
on top of the De Dion tube.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/016_De_Dion_in.jpg"><br>
<br>
15/12/10-Here I have rivited the brake hoses onto the De Dion tube and just managed to squeeze it into<br>
place from the wrong (left) side of the car. I did wonder if the garage would be wide enough.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/015_diff_top_bolt.jpg"><br>
<br>
<br>
12/12/10-This is the long top bolt that had to be bevelled at the end and drfted into place with some timber<br>
and a 21/2 pound club hammer. I just hope I don't have to disturb it for a long time.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/014_diff_in_place.jpg"><br>
<br>
12/12/10-I'd heard fitting the differential was tricky, and they were right. Here it is in place after<br>
about 4 hours work. The trick is to locate the top temporarily with a bar, and to locate the lower<br>
bolts, taking care to centralise the diff using lots of washers. It can be up to 2mm to one side<br>
I'm pleased to say mine is in the middle.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/013_handbrake_linkage.jpg"><br>
<br>
11/12/10-Before fitting the differential it is important to place the propshaft into the tunnel and to<br>
install the handbrake lever and cable. It's also a good idea to lubricate the propshaft bearings!<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/012_disc_central_now.jpg"><br>
<br>
11/12/10-I found the calipers didn't line up with the discs properly. After checking with the factory,<br>
I found I had the correct washers in the right places, but I wasn't happy. I managed to modify<br>
some very thin washers to get the alignment spot on, as you can see here.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/011_finished_ns_front.jpg"><br>
<br>
11/12/10-The braided brake hose has been fitted here. The front suspension is now complete aprt from brake<br>
pads. I'll fit them after doing the rear suspension, beacuse I'll have to clean the protective<br>
coating off the discs first.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/010_just_need_pads.jpg"><br>
<br>
11/12/10-The anti-roll bar went on surprisingly easily, I've heard people have had trouble getting the<br>
ends into the wishbone cups. The rubber covers look quite neat with the cable ties hidden underneath.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/009_Lizzy_torques_caliper.jpg"><br>
<br>
11/12/10-Here Lizzy is helping me with the brake calipers.<br> 
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/008_uprights_on.jpg"><br>
<br>
7/12/10-Front suspension almost complete, just waiting for the anti-roll bar, brake calipers and hoses.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/007_ns_front_suspension.jpg"><br>
<br>
7/12/10-The upright has been installed now. The top shock absorber mounting bolt is very difficult<br>
to install. The manual says gently push the alloy inwards to remove/replace the bolt.<br>
I found that I had to bend the alloy skin with a wooden block to make the job even possible.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/006_front_ready_for_uprights.jpg"><br>
<br>
5/12/10-The wishbones and dampers have been installed. The wishbone bolts have to be tightened with<br>
a torque wrench with the wishbones horizontal, because access is very difficult later and the<br>
bushes should be in a relaxed position when the car is on its wheels.<br>  
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/005_steering_rack.jpg"><br>
<br>
4/12/10-Here the steering rack has been installed. The bolts were fitted with washers under the<br>
heads as described in the build guide. This is incorrect! They seemed wrong, so I contacted<br>
the factory, and they are now installed with the heads flush with the alloy.<br> 
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/004_ready_for_front_suspension.jpg">
<br>
<br>
4/12/10-Here is the chassis with bonnet removed, ready to start the front suspension.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/003_before_panels_put_in_loft.jpg">
<br>
<br>
4/12/10-Here is a picture of the chassis with the bonnet in place. All the detachable body panels<br>
were soon put safely in the loft.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/002_just_in_garage.jpg">
<br>
<br>
29/11/10-We unloaded very quickly and just dumped the large pieces in the garage and lots of boxes<br>
went into the lounge and dining room.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/001_sarah_with_van.jpg"> <br>
<br>
29/11/10-After a six month wait the car finally arrives, just before we had 12 inches of snow!<br>
Sarah arrived home just in time to see us unload the car.<br>
