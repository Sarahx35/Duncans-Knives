  <b>Twenty Four - an integral knife forged from a file with a six inch edge.
  </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 </font>
I have entered another KITH (knife in a hat) which is to be drawn in January. The theme was to<br>
forge a knife from a file. I decided that firstly, I wanted it to be obvious that the knife came<br>
from a file. And secondly, I wanted to forge another integral knife.<br>
<br>
Last time I was at the council tip, I picked up a big box of old files and punches for five pounds<br>
and it contained a large (blunt!) round file. I decided it would make good stock for this project.<br>
<br>
I used a fullering tool to forge the start of the handle, and then using a ball pien hammer forged<br>
the blade shape. I was careful to try and leave the file teeth visible on the handle and the back of<br>
blade. I finished the end of the handle by carefully heating it and forging it to a rounded profile.<br>
<br>
The blade is fully heat treated and tempered, and the handle is surprisingly comfortable.<br>
