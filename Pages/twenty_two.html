  <b>Knife Twenty Two - a blacksmith's knife with a 4 inch blade.
  </b>
 <br>
 <br>
 </font>
This knife was finished in May 2009 from an old leaf spring from a Daihatsu Fourtrack.<br>
Jacks Hammerin is on the theme of recycling this year, and I made this knife as a contribution<br>
to the raffle. It is a blacksmith's style knife with forged finish, because this is the quickest<br>
way to make a knife. I am hoping some people may want to try making one at the hammerin, and we<br>
can use this knife as a patern.<br>
<br>
I forged a taper into the blade and forged as close to the finished shape as possible. The only<br>
part that has been ground is the point and edge area. The blade is fully hardened and has a convex<br> polished edge that is shaving sharp.<br>
<br>
Recently I have made my own stamp from an old punch, so I am marking items I have forged with this now,<br>
as you can see in the top photo.<br>
<br>
Here are two photos of the finished knife:<br>
