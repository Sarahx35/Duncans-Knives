   Welcome to Duncan's Knife Pages
   </b>
  </font>
 <br>
  <img src="images/twenty_five_h.jpg">
 <br> 
This site has been set up purely for fun. I am also honing my technique to <br>
develop a website for my business in the future. I have been knife making  <br>
as a hobby since 2001, and find pattern welded or damascus steel fascinating<br>
The knife above is a pattern welded knife that I have made. You can see more<br>
pictures of this knife by following the link to the "My Knives" page.
<br>
<br>
I hope you enjoy the pictures on this site, and appreciate the time and    <br>
hard work needed to finish each blade. I have learnt all I know about      <br>
bladesmithing from Merv Allen who runs excellent hands on courses, from the<br>
 brilliant books of Jim Hrisoulas and from the members of British Blades at<br>
various hammerins and courses.
<br>

News 18/7/12-I have been informed by BT that they won't host personal websites<br>
like this one any more. Consequently, they will take this site down soon.<dr>
I don't intend paying for the site to be hosted elsewhere, so I plan to<br>
move any of the photos that are linked to other sites onto Photobucket.<br>
There is a link to my Photbucket page <a href="http://s1170.photobucket.com/albums/r538/underhay">here</a>
