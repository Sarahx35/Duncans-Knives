  <b>Twenty Five - a pattern welded knife with a 3 1/2 inch blade.
  </b>
  </font>
<br>
<br>
For a long time, I wanted to make a blade with a chevron pattern both sides of the blade.<br>
In the end, I could only think of one way to achieve this, so here are some photos<br>
showing the process I used. If you can think of an easier way, please let me know!<br>
<br>
<br>
The first step was to make a billet of 36 layers of 15n20 and EN42 spring steels:<br>
<br>

 <br>
<br>
The next stage was to deform the layers to get the right angle bend in the middle, so I made<br>
this tooling for my flypress:<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Here is a close up of the dies. I have set the press so the billet will be squeezed until it is 1/4 inch thick<br>
<br>
<br>

 <br>
<br>
I had to get the billet to a high temperature to use this tooling, and it was important to keep the<br>
billet aligned correctly. Here is a picture of the 36 layer pattern welded angle iron:<br>
<br>

 <br>
<br>
I now wanted to increase the number of layers, so I cut the billet into 1 inch sections, and ground<br>
off the scale. I then welded them into stack. There are rods at the side, so the arc welding could be<br>
ground off easily and wouldn't affect the pattern. You can also see a piece of mild bar with a bevelled<br>
end at the top. This steel is intended to form the tang once the billet is forged out:<br>
<br>

 <br>
<br>
The next photo shows the billet after it has been welded and the scale ground off to check for flaws.<br>
<br>

 <br>
<br>
You can see the layers in the side of the billet. During the next stage, most of the hammer blows were<br>
directed at this face to flatten the billet and consequently make it longer and wider. The layers started<br>
1 inch high and were about an 1/8th high when the blade profile had been forged. I forgot to take a photo<br>
after forging, but here is a picture after grinding and hardening:<br>
<br>

 <br>
<br>
Once the blade was polished and etched in ferric chloride, I made a bolster from black linen micarta, and<br>
fitted a handle made from palm wood with epoxy and a brass pin. The wood was very difficult to work, because<br>
the dark areas are very hard and the surrounding wood very soft. It can only be filed and sanded to shape, as<br>
the hard pieces can easily break away from the rest of the wood.<br>
<br>
I would have preferred the layers to have a sharp 90 degree bend on the midline of the blade, but as you can see<br>
from the following pictures of the finished knife, they have more of a U shape than a V. However, I'm quite pleased<br>
with the way it has turned out.<br>
