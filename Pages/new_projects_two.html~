My latest project is to build a Caterham Roadsport kitcar.<br>
Below are photos of the build in order of date with the latest first.<br>
<br>
Explanations are below the pictures:

<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/039_engine_bay_jan9.jpg"><br>
<br>
9/1/10-This shows the engine bay so far. The next stage is to intsall the radiator, heater and cooling system.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/038_steering_c.jpg"><br>
<br>
9/1/10-I finally had a chance to fit the steering wheel, and it looks quite good. Fitting the column bush was<br>
better than I remember last time I did the job on my Elan.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/037_steering_b.jpg"><br>
<br>
9/1/10-This photo shows the other end of the column. The universal joint is set so the pivots are vertical<br>
and horizontal to "equalize steering movement". Not something I've done before, but it may make some difference.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/036_steering_a.jpg"><br>
<br>
9/1/10-Once the manifolds were on I could finally install the steering column. You can see the column clamp here,<br>
and the clutch hose has been fitted. I am painting a red mark on bolts that I have torqued up. I still have to<br>
tidy up the wiring loom, but I'll wait until I've made all the connections first.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/035_catalyst.jpg"><br>
<br>
9/1/10-Next I fitted the catalyst. Getting the retaining springs on was a nightmare, but I found compressing<br>
the springs using cable ties made it a lot less risky. You can see the lambda probe coming out at the top. The<br>
wiring is routed under the car to keep the wires away from the hot pipes.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/034_exhaust_manifold.jpg"><br>
<br>
9/1/10-Today I fitted the exhaust manifold pipes. There isn't much room to get them in, but they fit very nicely.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/033_installation_4.jpg"><br>
<br>
2/1/10-This view of the front of the engine was taken after we had the engine mount and gearbox bolts in<br>
place. If you look closely you can see the left hand engine mount bolt is very high. This is because I<br>
hadn't been suppiled with the correct shorter bolt for this side. I have temporarily used the wrong bolt to<br>
locate the mount.<br> 
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/032_installation_3.jpg"><br>
<br>
2/1/10-Lizzy also helped out a lot, and was also official photographer for the day.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/031_installation_2.jpg"><br>
<br>
2/1/10-There was no way I could have installed the engine on my own. I'd heard the clearances were tight,<br>
but didn't realise quite how tight! Here Alison is helping me check the positioning.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/030_installation_1.jpg"><br>
<br>
2/1/10-The big day has arrived, we are ready to install to engine and gearbox. I had worried that there wasn't<br>
enough height in the air chamber, but that wasn't a problem. Instead we had trouble with the legs being too<br>
wide to go between the front wheels! I had to use spacers on the hubs. The legs were also rather high and I<br>
thought the car would drop onto the crane when the engine weight compressed the suspension. To get around<br>
this I placed wooden blocks under the jacking point to take the load until the crane was removed.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/029_engine_ready_to_install.jpg"><br>
<br>
1/1/10-This photo shows the engine and gearbox assembly ready to install. As you can see there is<br>
very little space with the car pushed back into the garage for the night. The engine crane is beside<br>
the tool trolley where I had stored the engine. Up until today, I had to keep the engine crane<br>
outside covered with a tarpauline.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/028_wheels_on.jpg"><br>
<br>
1/1/10-Here the car has its wheels on for the first time. With our sloping driveway and small<br>
garage, I had to find a way to safely roll the car out of the garage to make room for the crane<br>
that I will use to install the engine. I bought some timber and screwed the pieces together to make<br>
ramps, and rested the ends on my old wheel ramps. The ramps are horizontal and allow me to easily<br>
roll the car in and out by hand. Note the clamped wheel chock to make sure I don't overshoot.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/027_NS_engine_mount_rubber.jpg"><br>
<br>
1/1/10-This shows the left side engine mounting block. One of the earth cables is also attached,<br>
the other end of the cable will bolt to the engine block.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/026_washer.jpg"><br>
<br>
1/1/10-Here is a view of the washer reservoir. It had been fitted at the factory, but I needed to<br>
remove it to fit the heat shield. I've also heard that the way it is just riveted to thin aluminuim<br>
isn't strong enough and some owners have had the reservior come loose. I placed a steel plate and washers<br>
on the other side of the alloy skin, so I hope this will last.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/025_clutch_release_mechanism.jpg"><br>
<br>
1/1/10-This is a view inside the bell housing showing the clutch release bearing. The clutch is<br>
operated hydraulically.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/024_bell_housing_and_gearbox_joined.jpg"><br>
<br>
1/1/10-This is a photo of the gearbox joined to the bell housing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/023_OS_footwell_heatshield.jpg"><br>
<br>
23/12/10-The Caterham is generally well designed, but the forums have alerted me to the presence of a<br>
design flaw. There is a space between the chassis tubes/footwell lining and the alloy side skin.<br>
This has become known as the "grot trap", and once it has filled with salt and muck from the engine<br>
bay, corrosion is inevitable. When I was at the factory, I noticed they use self adhesive heat shield<br>
to protect the footwells from the heat of Duratec 2 litre cars, and this sheild also neatly covered<br>
the grot trap. Consequently, I've sourced some of this sheet from ebay and here is a picture of it fitted.<br>
It wasn't an easy job, but went better than I'd feared. A small amount of silicone sealant completed the job.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/022_NS_hub_complete.jpg"><br>
<br>
22/12/10-I have now finished the rear suspension. This shows the NS rear hub complete with caliper, disc<br>
and the handbrake cable attached. I will fill the differential with oil next, then move on to preparing<br>
the engine and gearbox.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/caterham/021_A_frame.jpg"><br>
<br>
21/12/10-Here is a view below the rear suspension showing the A frame. The suspension bushes aren't torqued<br>
up until after the car is on it's wheels with the engine fitted, so the suspension is at the correct level.<br>
